# alarm-example_forgetting
Reproducing the ICLR 2019 paper AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF EXAMPLE FORGETTING
DURING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING

-- TEAM ALARM




What we will replicate
- [ ] Forgetting events: replicate the 3 histograms of figure 1 on page 4

- [ ] Visual inspection: visualize some of the unforgettable vs forgettable examples similar to figure 2

- [ ] Removing unforgettable examples: replicate figure 5 both the left and right charts and figure 6, and implement the ResNet architecture as well used for this experiment

- [ ] Transferable Forgetting Events: replicate all the diagrams in figure 7 as shown on page 8
