# alarm-example_forgetting
Reproducing the ICLR 2019 paper AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF EXAMPLE FORGETTING
DURING DEEP NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING

-- TEAM ALARM





i) Forgetting events - We will replicate the 3 histograms of figure 1 on page 4

ii) Visual inspection - We will also visualize some of the unforgettable vs forgettable examples similar to figure 2

iii) Removing Unforgettable examples - We will replicate figure 5 both the left and right charts and we will implement the ResNet architecture as well used for this experiment

We will also replicate figure 6.

iv) Transferable Forgetting Events - We will replicate figure 7 all the diagrams as shown on page 8.
